# Intelligent Restaurant Review Analyser

A machine learning application for analyzing restaurant reviews, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for aspect-based classification and sentiment analysis. This project features a Streamlit web application that provides insights into review aspects and sentiment.

## Features

- **Aspect Classification**: Identifies and classifies different aspects of the review, such as service, food, and price.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines the sentiment of the review, classifying it as positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Handles contractions and negations for improved text representation.
- **Interactive Web Interface**: Provides an easy-to-use interface to input reviews and view analysis results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip



## Model Performance

The performance metrics for aspect classification and sentiment analysis, such as accuracy and precision, are displayed after training. These metrics help assess the effectiveness of the models.
